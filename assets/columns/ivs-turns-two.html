<p>The Ivy Student Voice is two years old. Two of our editors provided essays on their experiences over the past year.</p>
                      <p>We need a new editorial team for the fall 2015 semester. Interested students can register for EPCS 101 (1 credit hour). If you have any questions, or if you want to be involved but can't take the class, contact us at BL-StudentVoice@ivytech.edu.</p>
                      <p>This class is for you if you are interested in any aspect of journalism.</p>
                      <p>From our departing editors:</p>
                      <h2>Parting is Such Sweet Sorrow</h2>
                      <p class="entry-details">By Christina Feaster</p>
<p>This morning while I was ruminating on my last journalism assignment inspiration struck; when this happens, you must write.</p> 
 <p>We are all very busy students right now: two weeks of classes, finals to take, and deadlines to meet. During these times we often miss the beauty in what is happening around us. As a writer we must soak up everything. Life is fodder for the story that lies ahead. Absorb it.</p>
<p>I have completed another semester. Another 16 weeks of stuffing my brain full of useful information. I learned a great deal, but not nearly enough. I have put over 5000 words to print and would do more. I have become attached to this newspaper and my fellow cohort and I will miss it and them. All of these are beautiful things and I am happy that I was a part of them.</p>
<p>So, now what? For me, I am on to another beat (journalism lingo). For you, it’s your turn. Our beloved, Ivy Student Voice, turns two this month and it needs you. It needs you to continue to nurture it and bring it forward. It needs you to get the story and inform the students. It needs you make it the best.</p> 
<p>You know, some people just say it better or maybe they just get you to a place where you can put fingers to the keyboard. Dr. Seuss was the driving force in my reflecting today. “Sometimes you will never know the value of something until it becomes a memory.” He said this; what a smart man. I have my memories of the good ol’ Ivy Voice. Now it’s time to make yours.</p>
                      <h2>So You Want To Be A Student Journalist</h2>
                      <p class="entry-details">By Matt Batman</p>
                      <p>I’ve worked on the Ivy Student Voice for the past two semesters as a writer, editor, web and page layout designer. Enrolling in the newspaper class has effectively provided me an internship, as well as a class in journalism.</p>

<p>The Ivy Student Voice may not be the most well-known college newspaper in Bloomington, nor have anything close to the most resources, but that can be an advantage for an entrepreneurial student. There are effectively no expectations, no procedures that new students will need to conform to next semester. They can forge a new culture and readership.</p>

<p>They can also build new skills. Prior to taking the class, I had never used Adobe InDesign. I’ve now used it to design six papers.</p>

<p>A student newspaper, however, isn’t just about self-improvement or building a resume or “getting a job.” A newspaper is a means of creation and connection. It allows students to express, “this is what life is like for me” and “this is how it seems to be going for these other people.”</p>
