     <h1>A Few Tips on Transferring</h1>

<p>Transferring is stressful: submitting transcripts, exploring new degree programs, learning a new campus and new classroom dynamics - it can all be overwhelming. As an Ivy Tech graduate and current Indiana University student, I want to share a few things that I’ve learned from my transition, most of which start long before the actual transfer process begins.</p>
<p>Take courses that will transfer toward your degree: While many courses transfer from Ivy Tech to IU, only specific courses will count toward your degree. For example, I took a lot of English classes here at Ivy Tech, and every credit transferred to IU; this allowed me to use Ivy Tech classes to develop my content knowledge, critical thinking and interpretive skills, but these credits did not count toward my IU English degree. Different schools have different requirements for how many transfer credits you can use toward your degree. You’ll have to contact the four year institution for specific advice, but I used a year of my Ivy Tech career working towards a Transfer General Education Core (TGEC) certificate. This satisfied most of the general education core requirements for my IU degree, allowing me to move directly into upper-level (300 and above), major-specific classes. For questions regarding which classes transfer, see <a href="http://cts.admissions.indiana.edu/transferin.cfm">http://cts.admissions.indiana.edu/transferin.cfm</a></p>
<p>Talk in classes: Ivy Tech boasts small class sizes because small classes feel more comfortable and allow students to communicate more directly with their teachers, so take advantage of it. Many upper-level classes are also smaller and discussion based, particularly in the humanities, and they require class participation. If you are used to engaging in class discussion at Ivy Tech, you will have an easy transition into a new classroom environment.</p>
<p>Get help in your weaker areas: This may seem obvious, but make it a habit before you transfer. Ivy Tech has A LOT of student resources. There is a conveniently located tutoring center (ASC), online writing help (COWS), and many teachers are willing to meet students individually. Get accustomed to using these resources while you are in the same building with them. IU offers many similar services, but they are more spread out and often harder, but not impossible, to access. If you are in the habit of asking for help here, you’ll ask for help when you transfer, no matter the inconvenience.</p>
<p>Go to office hours: Again, start this now. Habits don’t just happen in new environments. You have a face at Ivy Tech because classes are small. IU has bigger classes; therefore, you have no face unless you seek out your teachers. Office hours are only awkward if you have never been to them. Professors are often very nice, and most of the time, they are real people. Talk to them.
<p>Avoid online classes: When you transfer, you will be met with rigorous course material. Online classes are great if you are trying to knock out general education requirements, but they don’t always build the necessary foundation for major-specific learning, which could backfire when you transfer. There are exceptions all over the place for this one, but I’m talking to the general here. In general, easier is not always better.</p>
                      <p>Talk to advisers at both institutions: They are used to dealing with transfer students, and they know their institution. Remember, advisers do not know what’s best for you; only you know that, but they can help to inform your decisions. Also, talk to your teachers or administrators; most will have personal experience in a variety of roles in academia. Course-load, specific classes, scheduling, etc. are your decisions. Use the resources to make informed decisions, but don’t let them make decisions for you.</p>
