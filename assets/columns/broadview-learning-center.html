<p>We do many things just because we think it is good for us. We take vitamins, exercise and drink plenty of water. Sometimes we do things that are uncomfortable or challenging because they provide a benefit to us or others. We might make a blood donation to a local drive. Or we go to see our dentist twice a year to keep our teeth healthy. No one makes us do these things, but we do them. I want to tell you about one of those “good for you” things I have been doing.</p>
<p>Does math make you squirm? Do you find it challenging? Is it the one class you wish you could catapult into oblivion? My answer to all three is a very clear yes. That is why I have been meeting this challenge head-on and voluntarily attending The Broadview Learning Center (BLC) while I am currently attending Ivy Tech (IT). The BLC is part of the Monroe County Community School Corporation for Bloomington and it offers adult learners help in improving their basic skills. In my case, some help strengthening my math competency.</p> 
<p>My history with the BLC goes far enough back that my first time attending this class is no longer in the system-probably 20 years. I have occupied space in their classrooms a total of four different time periods. My last hiatus was from 2009 until now, where I have altogether, over the years, logged in over 300 hours of tutoring. I am just about to finish out the school year at the BLC and then take my last math class at IT in the fall.</p>
<p>Math has always been an issue for me. I prefer words over numbers; we get along better. But for those who may need something different than the Adult Basic Ed classes the BLC does offer other areas of instruction as well. They offer preparatory classes for the TASC test (Test Assessing Secondary Completion/formerly known as the GED), ESL classes (English as a second language), Teen Learning Center Programs and Workforce Development.</p>
<p>This community asset is available for those who are 16 years-old and older and are not attending a K-12 school. There is no cost (except for the TASC test) and the only requirement is a time commitment. You also will be asked about what your goals are, what you are trying to accomplish. “We set goals with students - an adult learning plan -and basically when the goals are fulfilled, that is when we usually gently handoff the students to someone else,” said Roger Moore, director of adult education.” Like if they are going to college or if they are going into the workforce, whatever their goals happen to be.”</p>
<p>The Broadview Elementary School was renovated in 2005 and now houses the BLC. The walls bear murals depicting children’s classic literature, giving it a happy aura. My class has generally ebbed and flowed with students. This varied class size can be a benefit for individualized instruction. Chris Harmon teaches adult basic ed. He has fourteen years’ experience teaching, with a background teaching elementary, middle school, and now adults. When asked the difference in teaching adults as opposed to younger grades he said, “I am a lot more free to teach the way teaching should be. Teach for understanding. If you do not understand, than I can teach it again. Whereas in elementary, you just go on.”</p>
<p>Struggles in math are not a new thing. Just Google something derogatory about math: you will find some math angst out there. Many of us just need a little extra help getting comfortable with numbers, making them our friends. Moore suggests that students seek out the BLC (705 W. Coolidge Dr./ 330-7731) to work on needed skills. “We can help them brush up on those skills to make them successful,” he said. “So if they are struggling in a subject that is kinda a barrier to other kinds of training or employment, come to us.”</p>
<p>The only way to beat a problem is to meet a problem with your pencil sharpened and fresh batteries in your calculator. I asked Harmon what suggestions he has for students who want to slay the math dragon. “All math works off of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division,” he said. Those four things is what it all comes down to.” So, if this resonates with you or you know someone who could use the extra help, let them read my article or give the BLC a call. The BLC center has made a difference in my life and I want to pass on the good news.</p>
