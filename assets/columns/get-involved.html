<p>Would you be interested in an opportunity to discover your passion and strengths? Would you want to be apart of opportunities that will let you meet new people?

<p>Become involved at Ivy Tech - I did. As the Director of Publicity and Outreach for our Student Government  I was asked to speak to some of Ivy Tech’s State Trustees and Chancellors at a luncheon last semester, I’ve participated in many Leadership Development functions, and I’ve gained a great resume builder that can take me as far as I want to go.</p>
