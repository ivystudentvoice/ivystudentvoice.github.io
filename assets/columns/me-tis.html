	<p>The Eighth edition of the Ivy Tech Literary magazine m&ecirc tis was launched Tuesday April 21st at the Waldron Arts Center. Competition winners who were published read creative written work to a full house and many shared their creative process.  Along with the authors, artists who won in a parallel competition shared slides of their work. After the the winners finished their presentation, audience members were invited to read their own work during an open mic time. There was a wide variety of readings and the evening was very entertaining. My only disappointment was that the artwork was not on display.</p>

	<p>Dr. Emily Bobo founded  me&ecirc tis eight years ago here at Ivy Tech Bloomington and has continued to be the academic advisor for during that time. Next year is the first year that admissions will be accepted from other Ivy Tech campuses, which could raise its profile and help the publication to grow even bigger.</p>
