<p>Are you looking for your next good read? Faculty member Colleen Wells has her first published book, “Dinner With Dopplegangers, - A True Story of Madness and Recovery”, being released April 11, 2015. In her book she chronicles her 22 struggle with depression and bipolar disorder. In the press release she answers questions about the book and gives advice to readers about writing.</p>

<p>Q: What was your motivation in writing this book?</p>

<p>A: I needed to write about my experiences with mental illness as an exercise in writing for my own healing and in writing what I know. My hope is that through sharing my story with others impacted by mental illness, it might inspire the courage for others to share their own stories. I also want to make a dent in the stigma around mental illness.</p>

<p>Q: Why did you choose this method of telling your story?</p>

<p>A: First it was a manageable way to share it. The format also compliments the message by illuminating events and feelings in short bursts or insights almost like manic thoughts. Some of these vignettes came to me originally as poems, others as short essays.</p>

<p>Q: What advice do you have for family members dealing with similar situations?</p>

<p>A: Be the best advocate you can be for your loved one. Seek support by connecting with others who have gone through similar events. Knowledge is power. Educate yourself. Rely on family and friends for respite. Practice your own self care.</p>

<p>Q: You’ve had a number of mental health care providers. Which one influenced your recovery or relapse the most?</p>

<p>A: I was blessed to have a very understanding doctor at the health center during my undergraduate years. He was skilled at working with young adults. I have a wonderful psychiatrist now. There have been instances where I wasn’t as lucky. That’s why it’s important to always advocate for yourself, and to communicate to your family what your wishes are for any future relapse.</p>
      
<p>Q:  What authors do you admire?</p>

<p>A:   I grew up reading Beverly Cleary, Roald Dahl, Shel Silverstein, and Dr. Seuss. In college I loved reading Lorrie Moore, Sylvia Plath, J. D. Salinger, John Steinbeck, and Richard Wright. Currently I read a lot of young adult novels. Authors I admire include Laurie Halse Anderson, John Green, and Ellen Hopkins. I love Raymond Carver’s short stories and wish I were friends with Wally Lamb.</p>

<p>Q:  Are there any future projects you have in mind?</p>

<p>A: I’d like to help create an anthology of writings on mental illness. One of my favorite such collections is Writers on Depression, edited by Nell Casey. I’d also like to write something that impacts animal welfare in some kind of positive way, and I’d love to try my hand at a young adult novel.</p>

 <p>Q: What writing advice do you have for first-time authors?</p>
  
 <p>A:   Read a ton, take classes or workshops as feels right to you, and surround yourself with a merry band of helpers. I am grateful for the instructors and mentors I’ve had, the writing workshops, seminars, and groups I’ve been a part of. Without having been lifted up by these influential people and experiences, my book wouldn’t exist.</p>
