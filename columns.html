                      <p>We do many things just because we think it is good for us. We take vitamins, exercise and drink plenty of water. Sometimes we do things that are uncomfortable or challenging because they provide a benefit to us or others. We might make a blood donation to a local drive. Or we go to see our dentist twice a year to keep our teeth healthy. No one makes us do these things, but we do them. I want to tell you about one of those “good for you” things I have been doing.</p>

This is the time of year we enjoy hours of fun in the sun, swimming at the lake, hiking through the vast Indiana trails, camping in the woods and many a barbeque with family and friends. When given the task to bring a dish to share, impress the crowd with these delicious sweet and tangy lemon bars. These lemon bars are not to heavy and make a great dessert for the warm sumer months.</p>

I would say overall everyone agrees taking what is not ours is wrong. But, I daresay, is taking credit for someone else’s words or intellectual property really the same as taking someone’s tangible property. Affirmative, my friends. It is.</p>

With the generous help of the Office of Student Life, Ivy Tech Bloomington’s very own Campus Pride was able to send their three officers and one lucky member to attend the conference, accompanied by Beth Warner from the Office of Student Life.  Officers Katelyn Spencer (Vice President), Walt Walters (Secretary/Treasurer), and myself (President) had been looking forward to the event since we started seeking funding in November of 2014.</p>

                      <p>There was no question that Vice chancellor Sam DeWeese would end up working in higher education. He told me that “I literally grew up in a house that was across the street from the Ball State campus. My parents were both involved at Ball State in different capacities.” The K-12 school DeWeese attended was even operated by Ball State, and served as a training ground for Ball State student teachers. “I spent my entire adolescence on a college campus and I loved the idea of getting to be around people who were pursuing an education. I really can’t imagine doing anything else.”</p>
