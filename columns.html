With the generous help of the Office of Student Life, Ivy Tech Bloomington’s very own Campus Pride was able to send their three officers and one lucky member to attend the conference, accompanied by Beth Warner from the Office of Student Life.  Officers Katelyn Spencer (Vice President), Walt Walters (Secretary/Treasurer), and myself (President) had been looking forward to the event since we started seeking funding in November of 2014.</p>

                      <p>There was no question that Vice chancellor Sam DeWeese would end up working in higher education. He told me that “I literally grew up in a house that was across the street from the Ball State campus. My parents were both involved at Ball State in different capacities.” The K-12 school DeWeese attended was even operated by Ball State, and served as a training ground for Ball State student teachers. “I spent my entire adolescence on a college campus and I loved the idea of getting to be around people who were pursuing an education. I really can’t imagine doing anything else.”</p>
